## A cannabis strain recommender using 3 APIs and sentiment analysis

Inspired by my total lack of cannabis knowledge, I created an app that asks the user for a movie title, extracts the movie's plot, sends that plot to a machine learning sentiment analyzer, and, based on the movie's 'vibe', suggests a matching strain of cannabis.

Three APIs, and many API calls, are used to coordinate all this, and the UI is meant to simulate the dynamically-generated suggestions of state-of-the-art machine-learning tools like GPT-3. Check it out!
